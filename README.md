# Bakery Manger
###### Created by Michael Howell, Abbey Minett, Natalie Theodoropoulou, Harry Hibbins, Yu-Ling You (Daisy), and Lou Diane Rigodon (Elle).

This project was created under the category food, it's a bakery management system where a customer can signup, login, and place orders. After placing orders they can view their own profile which has the ability to show lists containing all of their orders. 
Similarly for the admin users who can view their own profile, view all orders sent to them organised by date: soonest to latest, as well as add new stock and edit their current stock.

# To get the project set up: in both frontend and backend run
``` 
npm install 
```
This will install all of the dependancies required for this to run smoothly.

# The process behind creating Bakery Manager
###### and how it came to be what it is now

We first began by creating an extensive Excalidraw, 
really getting into the depths of what we what the design to be, 
how it will function and interact with other pages of the website.

###### *This is what it looked like on the final day of implementing features!!*

Alongside this, we used a trello to truly keep track of where we were with implementing features and testing.
